\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
 
Extreme values investigation plays an important role in several
practical domains of applications, such as insurance, biology and
geology. For example, in \cite{Buishand2008}, the authors study
extremes to determine how severe rainfall periods occur in North
Holland. \cite{sharma1999} use an extreme values procedure to predict
violations of air quality standards. Various applications were
presented in a lot of areas such as hydrology \citep{DavisonSmith1990,
  katz2002}, insurance \citep{mcneil1997, rootzen1997} or finance
\citep{danielsson1997, mcneil1998, embrechts1999, gencay2004}. Other
applications range from rainfall data \citep{Gardes2010} to earthquake
analysis \citep{sornette1996}. The extreme value theory consists of using
appropriate statistical models to estimate extreme quantiles and
probabilities of rare events.

The idea of the approach implemented in the \proglang{R} \citep{Rsoft}
package \pkg{extremefit} \citep{extremefit}, which is available from
the Comprehensive \proglang{R} Archive Network (CRAN) at
\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=extremefit}, is to fit a
Pareto distribution to the data over a threshold $\tau$ using the
peak-over-threshold method.
%The choice of the threshold $\tau$ is a challenging problem. 
The choice of $\tau$ is a challenging problem, a large value can lead
to an important variability while a small value may increase the bias.
We refer to \cite{HallP1985}, \cite{DreesKaufmann1998},
\cite{GuillouHall2001}, \cite{Huisman2001}, \cite{BeirlantAl2004},
\cite{GramaSpokoiny2008, Grama2007} and \cite{ElMethniAl2012} where
several procedures for choosing the threshold $\tau$ have been
proposed.  Here, we adopt the method from \cite{GramaSpokoiny2008} and
\cite{DGPT2015}.  The package \pkg{extremefit} includes the modeling
of time dependent data. The analysis of time series involves a
bandwidth parameter $h$ whose data driven choice is non-trivial.  We
refer to \cite{Staniswalis1989} and \cite{loader2006} for the choice
of the bandwidth in a nonparametric regression.  For the purposes of
extreme value modeling, we use a cross-validation approach from
\cite{DGPT2015}.

The \pkg{extremefit} package is based on the methodology described in
\cite{DGPT2015}.  The package performs a nonparametric estimation of
extreme quantiles and probabilities of rare events. It proposes a
pointwise choice of the threshold $\tau$ and, for time series, a
global choice of the bandwidth $h$ and it provides graphical
representations of the results.

The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{ExtPack} gives an
overview of several existing \proglang{R} packages dealing with
extreme value analysis.  In Section~\ref{Model}, we describe the model
and the estimation of the parameters, including the threshold $\tau$
and the bandwidth $h$ choices.  Section~\ref{PackSim} contains a
simulation study whose aim is to illustrate the performance of our
approach.  In Section~\ref{app}, we give several applications on real
data sets and we conclude in Section~\ref{conclusion}.

\section{Extreme value packages}\label{ExtPack}

There exist several \proglang{R} packages dealing with the extreme
value analysis.  We give a short description of some of them. For a
detailed description of these packages, we refer to
\cite{Gilleland2013}.  There also exists a CRAN Task View on extreme
value analysis which gives a description of registered packages
available on CRAN \citep{Extreme-Value-view}. Among those available
packages, the well known peak-over-threshold method, we mentioned
before, has many implementations, e.g., in the \pkg{POT} package
\citep{POT}.

Some of the packages have a specific use, such as the package
\pkg{SpatialExtremes} \citep{SpatialExtremes}, which models spatial
extremes and provides maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian
hierarchical and copula modeling, or the package \pkg{fExtremes}
\citep{fExtremes} for financial purposes using functions from the
packages \pkg{evd} \citep{evd}, \pkg{evir} \citep{evir} and others.

The \pkg{copula} package \citep{copula} provides tools for exploring
and modeling dependent data using copulas.  The \pkg{evd} package
provides both block maxima and peak-over-threshold computations based
on maximum likelihood estimation in the univariate and bivariate
cases. The \pkg{evdbayes} package \citep{evdbayes} provides an
extension of the \pkg{evd} package using Bayesian statistical methods
for univariate extreme value models. The package \pkg{extRemes}
\citep{extRemes} implements also univariate estimation of block maxima
and peak-over-threshold by maximum likelihood estimation allowing for
non-stationarity. The package \pkg{evir} is based on fitting a
generalized Pareto distribution with the Hill estimator over a given
threshold. The package \pkg{lmom} \citep{lmom} is dealing with
L-moments to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions
and quantile estimations for reliability or survival analysis.  The
package \pkg{texmex} \citep{texmex} provides statistical extreme value
modeling of threshold excesses, maxima and multivariate extremes,
including maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation of parameters.
  
In contrast to previous described packages, the \pkg{extremefit}
package provides tools for modeling heavy tail distributions without
assuming a general parametric structure. The idea is to fit a
parametric Pareto model to the tail of the unknown distribution over
some threshold.  The remaining part of the distribution is estimated
nonparametrically and a data driven algorithm for choosing the
threshold is proposed in Section~\ref{Threshold}.  We also provide a
version of this method for analyzing extreme values of a time series
based on the nonparametric kernel function estimation approach.  A
data driven choice of the bandwidth parameter is given in
Section~\ref{bandwidth}.  These estimators are studied in more details
in \cite{DGPT2015}.


\section{Extreme value prediction using a semi-parametric model}\label{Model}

\subsection{Model and estimator}\label{ModelEstimator}

We consider $F_t(x) = \Prob(X\leq x | T=t)$ the conditional distribution of a random variable $X$ given a time covariate $T=t$, where $x \in [x_0, \infty )$ and $t \in [0,T_{\max}]$.
We observe independent random variables $X_{t_{1}},\ldots,X_{t_{n}}$ associated to a sequence of times $0\leq t_{1}<\ldots<t_{n}\leq T_{\max}$, such that 
for each $t_i$, the random variable $X_{t_i}$ has the distribution function $F_{t_i}$. 
The purpose of the \pkg{extremefit} package is to provide a pointwise estimation of the tail probability 
$S_{t}\left( x\right) =1-F_{t}\left(x\right) $ 
and the extreme $p$~quantile $F_{t}^{-1}\left( p\right) $ functions for any $t \in [0,T_{\max}]$, given $x>x_{0}$ and $p\in (0,1)$. 
We assume that $F_t$ is in the domain of attraction of the Fr\'echet distribution. The idea is to adjust, for some $\tau \geq x_0$, the excess distribution function
\begin{equation}\label{excess d.f.}
F_{t,\tau }\left( x\right) =1-\frac{1-F_{t}\left( x\right) }{1-F_{t}\left(\tau \right) },\;\;\;\;x\in \lbrack \tau ,\infty ) 
\end{equation}%
by a Pareto distribution:
\begin{equation}
G_{\tau ,\theta }\left( x\right) =1-\left( \frac{x}{\tau }\right) ^{-\frac{1}{\theta }},\;\;\;\;x\in \lbrack \tau ,\infty ),  \label{pareto 001}
\end{equation}%
where $\theta > 0$ and $\tau \geq x_0$ an unknown threshold, depending on
$t$.  The justification of this approach is given by the
Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem \citep[][Theorem
2.1]{BeirlantAl2004} which states that $F_t$ is in the domain of
attraction of the Fr\'echet distribution if and only if
$1-F_{t,\tau}(\tau x)\rightarrow x^{-1/\theta}$ as
$\tau \rightarrow \infty$.  This consideration is based on the
peak-over-threshold (POT) approach \citep{BeirlantAl2004}.  We
consider the semi-parametric model defined by:
\begin{equation}
F_{t,\tau ,\theta }\left( x\right) =\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
F_{t}\left( x\right) & \text{if\ \ }x\in \lbrack x_{0},\tau ], \\
1-\left( 1-F_{t}\left( \tau \right) \right) \left( 1-G_{\tau ,\theta }\left(
x\right) \right) & \text{if\ \ }x>\tau ,%
\end{array}%
\right.  \label{eq003}
\end{equation}%
where $\tau \geq x_0$ is the threshold parameter. We propose in the
sequel how to estimate $F_t$ and $\theta$ which are unknown in
(\ref{eq003}).


The estimator of $F_{t}(x)$ is taken as the weighted empirical distribution given by
\begin{equation}
\widehat{F}_{t,h}\left( x\right) =\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{t,h}(t_{j})}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_{t,h}(t_{i})\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t_{i}}\leq x\}},
\label{WDF}
\end{equation}
where, for $i=1,\ldots,n$,
$W_{t,h}(t_{i})=K\left( \frac{t_{i}-t}{h}\right)$ are the weights and
$K(\cdot)$ is a kernel function assumed to be continuous,
non-negative, symmetric with support on the real line such that
$K(x) \leq 1$, and $h>0$ is a bandwidth.


By maximizing the weighted quasi-log-likelihood function
\citep[see][]{DGPT2015,Staniswalis1989,loader2006}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{t,h}(\tau,\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n W_{t,h}(t_i)\log \frac{dF_{t,\tau,\theta}}{dx}(X_{t_i})
\end{equation}
with respect to $\theta$, we obtain the estimator
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\theta }_{t,h,\tau }=\frac{1}{\widehat{n}_{t,h,\tau }}%
\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_{t,h}(t_{i})\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t_{i}}>\tau \}}\log \left( \frac{%
X_{t_{i}}}{\tau }\right),  \label{eqn0018}
\end{equation}%
where
$
\widehat{n}_{t,h,\tau }=\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_{t,h}(t_{i})\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t_{i}}>\tau \}}
\label{n hat t h tau}
$
is the weighted number of observations over the threshold $\tau$.

Plugging-in (\ref{WDF}) and (\ref{eqn0018}) in the semi-parametric model (\ref{eq003}), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{F}_{t,h,\tau }\left( x\right) =\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\widehat{F}_{t,h}\left( x\right) & \text{if\ \ }x\in \lbrack x_{0},\tau ],
\\
1-\left( 1-\widehat{F}_{t,h}\left( \tau \right) \right) \left( 1- G_{\tau ,\widehat\theta_{t,h,\tau } }\left( x \right)\right) & \text{if\ \ }x>\tau .
\end{array}
\right.  \label{Est001}
\end{equation}%

For any $p \in (0,1)$, the estimator of the $p$~quantile of $X_t$ is defined by 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{q}_{p}(t,h) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
\widehat{F}_{t,h}^{-1}\left( p\right) & \text{if\ \ \ \ }p<\widehat{p}_{\tau
}, \\
\tau \left( \frac{1-\widehat{p}_{\tau }}{1-p}\right) ^{\widehat{\theta }%
_{t,h,\tau }} & \text{otherwise,}%
\end{array}%
\right.  \label{QuantEstimator}
\end{equation}%
where $\widehat p_\tau = \widehat{F}_{t,h}\left( \tau \right)$. 

\subsection{Selection of the threshold} \label{Threshold}


The determination of the threshold $\tau$ in model (\ref{Model}) is
based on a testing procedure which is a goodness-of-fit test for the
parametric-based part of the model. At each step of the procedure, the
tail adjustment to a Pareto distribution is tested based on $k$ upper
statistics. If it is not rejected, the number $k$ of upper statistics
is increased and the tail adjustment is tested again until it is
rejected. If the test rejects the parametric tail fit from the very
beginning, the Pareto tail adjustment is not significant. On the other
hand, if all the tests accept the parametric Pareto fit then the
underlying distribution $F_{t,\tau ,\theta }$ follows a Pareto distribution $G_{\tau ,\theta }$.  The critical value
denoted by $D$ depends on the kernel choice and is determined by
Monte-Carlo simulation, using the \code{CriticalValue} function of the
package.

 
In Table~\ref{kernel}, we display the critical values using \code{CriticalValue} obtained for several kernel functions.


\begin{table}[t!]

\begin{tabular}{lcl}

  Truncated Gaussian, $\sigma=1$ & $3.4$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left (-\frac{x^2}{2}\right )\mathbb{1}_{|x|\leq1}$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Critical values associated with kernel functions. The Gaussian kernel with standard deviation $1/3$ is approximated 
by the truncated Gaussian kernel $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left (-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right )\mathbb{1}_{|x|\leq1}$  
with $\sigma=1/3$.}
\label{kernel}
\end{table}

The default values of the parameters in the algorithm yielded satisfying
estimation results in a simulation study without being time-consuming
even for large data sets. The choice of these tuning parameters is
explained in \cite{DGPT2015}.

The following commands compute the critical value $D$ for the
truncated Gaussian kernel with $\sigma=1$ (default value) and display
the empirical distribution function of the goodness-of-fit test
statistic which determines the threshold $\tau$. The parameters $n$
and $N_{\mathit{MC}}$ define respectively the sample size and the number of
Monte-Carlo simulated samples.

  statistic.}

\end{figure}

For a given $t$, the function \code{hill.adapt} allows a data driven
choice of the threshold $\tau$ and the estimation of $\theta_t$.

\subsection{Selection of the bandwidth $h$}\label{bandwidth}

We determine the bandwidth $h$ by cross-validation from a sequence of
the form $h_l=aq^l,$ $l=0,\dots,M_h$ with
$q=\exp\left( \frac{\log b - \log a }{M_h} \right) $, where $a$ is the
minimum bandwidth of the sequence, $b$ is the maximum bandwidth of the
sequence and $M_h$ is the length of the sequence.  The choice is
performed globally on the grid $T_{\text{grid}}= \{ t_1,\dots,t_K\}$ of
points $t_i \in [0,T_{\max}]$, where the number $K$ of the points on
the grid is defined by the user.  The choice $K=n$ is possible but can
be time consuming for large samples. We recommend to use a fraction of
$n.$

We choose $h_{cv}$ by minimizing in $h_m,$ $m=1,\dots,M_h$ the cross-validation function
\begin{equation}
CV(h_m,p_{cv}) = \frac{1}{ M_h \mbox{card} ( T_{\text{grid}} )  }\sum_{h_l}   \sum_{t_i \in T_{\text{grid}}} 
\left| \log   \frac { \widehat{q}^{(-i)}_{p_{cv}} (t_i,h_m)} { \widehat{F}_{t_i,h_l}^{-1}\left( p_{cv}\right)  }   \right|,
\label{CV_function}
\end{equation}
where $ \widehat{F}_{t_i,h_l}^{-1}\left( p_{cv}\right)$ is the
empirical quantile from the observations in the window
$[t_i-h_l,t_i+h_l]$, $\widehat{q}^{(-i)}_{p_{cv}} (t_i,h_m )$ is the
quantile estimator inside the window $[t_i-h_m,t_i+h_m]$ defined by
(\ref{QuantEstimator}) with the observation $X_{t_i}$ removed and
$\tau$ being the adaptive threshold given by the remaining
observations inside the window $[t_i-h_m,t_i+h_m]$. The function
\code{bandwidth.CV} selects the bandwidth $h$ by cross-validation.

\section{Package presentation on simulated data}\label{PackSim}

In this section, we demonstrate the \pkg{extremefit} package by
applying it to two simulated data sets.

The following code displays the computation of the survival
probabilities and quantiles using the adaptive choice of the threshold
provided by the \code{hill.adapt} function.

\end{Schunk}
%
A simple use of the method described in Section~\ref{Model} is given by the following example. 
With $t_i=i/n$, we consider data $X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n}$ generated by the Pareto change-point model defined by
\begin{equation}
F_t(x) = \left(1-x^{-1/2\theta_t} \right) \mathbb{1}_{x\leq \tau} + \left(1-x^{-1/\theta_t} \tau^{1/2\theta_t} \right) \mathbb{1}_{x > \tau},
\label{ParCP}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{t}$ is a time varying parameter depending on
$t \in [0,1]$ defined by $\theta_t = 0.5+0.25\sin(2\pi t)$ and
$\tau = 3$ as described in \cite{DGPT2015}. We consider the sample
size $n=50000$. The following commands generate one sample from model
(\ref{ParCP}).
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> set.seed(5)
R> n <- 50000; tau <- 3
R> theta <- function(t){0.5 + 0.25 * sin(2 * pi * t)}
R> Ti <- 1:n / n; Theta <- theta(Ti)
R> X <- rparetoCP(n, a0 = 1 / (Theta * 2), a1 = 1 / Theta, x1 = tau)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
The \pkg{extremefit} package provides the estimates of $\theta_{t}$, $q_{p}(t,h)$ and $F_{t}\left( x\right)$ for large values of $x$ particularly. We select the bandwidth $h_{cv}$ by minimizing the cross-validation function implemented in \code{bandwidth.CV}. The weights are computed using the truncated Gaussian kernel ($\sigma=1$), which is implemented in \code{TruncGauss.kernel}. This kernel implies $D=3.4$. 
To select the bandwidth $h_{cv}$, we define a grid of possible values of $h$ as indicated in Section~\ref{bandwidth} with $a=0.005$, $b=0.05$ and $M_h=20$. Moreover, we fix the parameter $p_{cv} = 0.99.$ The parameter $T_{\text{grid}}$ defines a grid of $t \in T_{\text{grid}}$ to perform the cross-validation.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> a <- 0.005; b <- 0.05; Mh <- 20
R> hl <- bandwidth.grid(a, b, Mh, type = "geometric")
R> Tgrid <- seq(0, 1, 0.02)
R> Hcv <- bandwidth.CV(X, Ti, Tgrid, hl, pcv = 0.99,  
+    kernel = TruncGauss.kernel, CritVal = 3.4, plot = FALSE)
R> Hcv$h.cv
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 0.02727797
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
%
For each $t \in
T_{\text{grid}}$, we determine the data driven threshold
$\tau$ and the estimates $\widehat
\theta_{t,h_{cv},\tau}$ using the function \code{hill.ts}.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> Tgrid <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)
R> hillTs <- hill.ts(X, Ti, Tgrid, h = Hcv$h.cv, 
+    kernel = TruncGauss.kernel, CritVal = 3.4)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
For each $t \in T_{\text{grid}}$, we display $\widehat \theta_{t,h_{cv},\tau}$   and the true value $\theta_t = 0.5+0.25\sin(2\pi t)$  in Figure~\ref{ThetEs}.
%used to generate data from the model (\ref{ParCP}).
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> plot(Tgrid, hillTs$Theta)
R> lines(Ti, Theta, col = "red")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
\begin{figure}[t!]

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth, trim = 0 15 0 50, clip]{ThetaEst.pdf}

\label{ThetEs}
\end{figure}

The estimates of the quantiles and the survival probabilities are
determined using the \proglang{S}3 method \code{predict} for
`\code{hill.ts}' objects. For instance the estimate of the
$p$~quantile $F_{t}^{-1}\left( p\right)
$ %quantiles $\widehat{q}_{p}(t,h_{cv})$
of order $p= 0.99$ and
$p=0.999$ are computed with the following \proglang{R} commands:

%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> p <- c(0.99, 0.999)
R> PredQuant <- predict(hillTs, newdata = p, type = "quantile")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
Figure~\ref{qEst} displays the true and the estimated quantiles of

In the same way, we estimate for each $t \in T_{\text{grid}}$ the
survival probabilities $S_t(x)=1-F_t(x).$ The \code{predict} method
for `\code{hill.ts}' objects with the option \code{type = "survival"}
computes the estimated survival function for a given $x.$ For each
$t \in T_{\text{grid}}$, the following commands compute the estimate

The estimations of the quantile and the survival function displayed in

Now we analyze the performance of the quantile estimator via a

results on a simulation study using $N_{\mathit{MC}}=1000$ Monte-Carlo
replicates. The iteration of the previous \proglang{R} commands on
$N_{\mathit{MC}}=1000$ simulations are not given because of the

\section{Real-world data sets}\label{app}

\subsection{Wind data}

The wind is mainly studied in the framework of an alternative to fossil
energy. Studies of wind speed in extreme value theory were made to
model wind storm losses or detect areas which can be subject to
hurricanes \citep[see][]{rootzen1997,simiu1996}.

The wind data in the package \pkg{extremefit} comes from the Airport of
Brest (France) and represents the average wind speed per day from 1976
to 2005. The data set is included in the package \pkg{extremefit} and
can be loaded by the following code.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> data("dataWind", package = "extremefit")
R> attach(dataWind)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
The commands below illustrate the function \code{hill.adapt} on the
wind data set and computes a monthly estimation of the survival
probabilities $1-\widehat{F}_{t,h,\tau }\left( x\right)$ for a given
$x = 100$ km/h with the \code{predict} method for `\code{hill.adapt}'
objects.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> pred <- vector("numeric", 12)
R> for (m in 1:12) {
+    indices <- which(Month == m)
+    X <- Speed[indices] * 60 * 60 / 1000
+    H <- hill.adapt(X)
+    pred[m] <- predict(H, newdata = 100, type = "survival")$p
+  }
R> plot(pred, ylab = "Estimated survival probability", xlab = "Month")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%

   \caption{Plot of the estimated survival probability $1-\widehat{F}_{t,h,\tau }\left( x\right)$ at $x=100$ km/h.}
   \label{wind}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Sea shores water quality}

The study of the pollution in the aquatic environment is an important
problem. Humans tend to pollute the environment through their
activities and the water quality survey is necessary for
monitoring. The bivalve's activity is investigated by modeling the
valve movements using high frequency valvometry. The electronic
equipment is described in \cite{TranAl2003} and modified by
\cite{Chambon2007}. More information can be found at
\url{http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/}.

High-frequency data (10 Hz) are produced by noninvasive valvometric
techniques and the study of the bivalve's behavior in their natural
habitat leads to the proposal of several statistical models
\citep{MS11, Schmitt2011, Jou2006, CoudretAl2013, Az2014, DGPT2015,
  durrieu2016dynamic}.  It is observed that in the presence of a
pollutant, the activity of the bivalves is modified and consequently
they can be used as bioindicators to detect perturbations in aquatic
systems (pollutions, global warming). A group of oysters {\it
  Crassostrea gigas} of the same age are installed around the world
but we concentrate on the Locmariaquer site (GPS coordinates
$47^{\circ}34$ N, $2^{\circ}56$ W) in France. The oysters are placed
in a traditional oyster bag. In the package \pkg{extremefit}, we
provide a sample of the measurements for one oyster over one day. The
data can be accessed by
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> data("dataOyster", package = "extremefit")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
The description of the data can be found with the \proglang{R} command
\code{help("dataOyster", package = "extremefit")}. The following code
covers the velocities and the time covariate and also displays the
data.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> Velocity <- dataOyster$data[, 3]
R> time <- dataOyster$data[, 1]
R> plot(time, Velocity, type = "l", xlab = "time (hour)", 
+    ylab = "Velocity (mm/s)")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth, trim = 0 15 0 50, clip]{Speed.pdf}
   \caption{Plot of the velocity of the valve closing and opening over one day.}
   \label{SpOy}
\end{figure}

We observe in Figure~\ref{SpOy} that the velocity is equal to zero in two periods of time. 
To facilitate the study of these data, we have included a time grid where the intervals with null velocities are removed.
The grid of time can be accessed by \code{dataOyster$Tgrid}. 
We shift the data to be positive.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> new.Tgrid <- dataOyster$Tgrid 
R> X <- Velocity + (-min(Velocity)) 
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
The bandwidth parameter is selected by the cross-validation method
($h_{cv}=0.2981812$) using \code{bandwidth.CV} but we select it
manually in the following command due to the long computation time.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> hcv <- 0.2981812
R> TS.Oyster <- hill.ts(X ,t = time, new.Tgrid, h = hcv, 
+    TruncGauss.kernel, CritVal = 3.4)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
The estimations of the extreme quantile of order $0.999$ and the
probabilities of rare events are computed as described in
Section~\ref{Threshold}. The critical value of the sequential test is
$D = 3.4$ when considering a truncated Gaussian kernel, see
Table~\ref{kernel}. A global study on a set of $16$ oysters on a $6$
months period is given in \cite{DGPT2015}.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> pred.quant.Oyster <- predict(TS.Oyster, newdata = 0.999, 
+    type = "quantile")
R> plot(time, Velocity, type = "l", ylim = c(-0.5, 1),
+    xlab = "Time (hour)", ylab = "Velocity (mm/s)")
R> quant0.999 <- rep(0, length(seq(0, 24, 0.05)))
R> quant0.999[match(new.Tgrid, seq(0, 24, 0.05))] <- 
+    as.numeric(pred.quant.Oyster$y) - (-min(Velocity))
R> lines(seq(0, 24, 0.05), quant0.999, col = "red")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
In \cite{DGPT2015} and \cite{durrieu2016dynamic}, we observe that
valvometry using extreme value theory allows in real-time {\it in
  situ} analysis of the bivalve behavior and appears as an effective
early warning tool in ecological risk assessment and marine
environment monitoring.

\subsection{Electric consumption}

Electric consumption is an important challenge due to population
expansion and increasing needs in a lot of countries. Obviously this
consumption is dealing with the state procurement policies. Therefore
statistical models may give an understanding of electric
consumption. Multiple models have been used to forecast the electric
consumption, as regression and time series models \citep{bianco2009,
  ranjan1999, harris1993, bercu2013sarimax}. \cite{durand2004analyse}
used a hidden Markov model to forecast the electric consumption. 

A research project conducted in France (Lorient, GPS coordinates
$47^{\circ}45$ N, $3^{\circ}22$ W) concerns the measurements of
electric consumption using Linky, a smart communica\-ting electric
meter
(\url{http://www.enedis.fr/linky-communicating-meter}). Installed in
end-consumer's dwellings and linked to a supervision center, this
meter is in constant interaction with the network. The Linky electric
meter allows a measurement of the electric consumption every 10
minutes.

To prevent from major power outages, the SOLENN project
(\url{http://www.smartgrid-solenn.fr/en/}) is testing an alternative
to load shedding. Data of electric consumption are collected on
selected dwellings to study the effect of a decrease on the maximal
power limit. For example, an dwelling with a maximal electric power
contract of $9$ kiloVolt ampere is decreased to $6$ kiloVolt
ampere. This experiment enables to study the consumption of the
dwelling with the application of an electric constraint related to the
need of the network. For instance, after an incident such as a power
outage on the electric network, the objective is to limit the number
of dwellings without electricity. If during the time period where the
electric constraint is applied, the electric consumption of the
dwelling exceeds the restricted maximal power, the breaker cuts off
and the dwelling has no more electricity. The consumer can, at that
time, close the circuit breaker and gets the electricity back.  In any
cases, at the end of the electric constraint, the network manager can
close the breaker using the Linky electric meter which is connected to
the network.  The control of the cutoff breakers is crucial to prevent
a dissatisfaction of the customers and to detect which dwellings are
at risk.

The extreme value modeling approach described in Section~\ref{Model}
was carried out on the electric consumption data for one dwelling from
December 24, $2015$ to June 29, $2016$.  This data are available in
the \pkg{extremefit} package and Figure~\ref{ElecEx} displays the
electric consumption of one dwelling. This dwelling has a maximal
power contract of $9$ kVA.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> data("LoadCurve", package = "extremefit")
R> Date <- as.POSIXct(LoadCurve$data$Time * 86400, origin = "1970-01-01")
R> plot(Date, LoadCurve$data$Value / 1000, type = "l", 
+    ylab = "Electric consumption (kVA)", xlab = "Date")
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
\begin{figure}[t!]

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth, trim = 0 15 0 50, clip]{ConsEx.pdf}
\caption{Electric consumption of one customer from December 24, $2015$ to June 29, $2016$.}
\label{ElecEx}
\end{figure}
We consider the following grid of time $T_{\text{grid}}$:
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> Tgrid <- seq(min(LoadCurve$data$Time), max(LoadCurve$data$Time),
+    length = 400)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
We observe in April 2016 missing values in Figure~\ref{ElecEx} due to
a technical problem. We modify the grid of time by removing the
intervals of $T_{\text{grid}}$ with no data.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> new.Tgrid <- LoadCurve$Tgrid
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
We choose the truncated Gaussian kernel and the associated critical
value of the goodness-of-fit test is
$D=3.4$ (see Table~\ref{kernel}). The bandwidth parameter is selected
by the cross-validation method
($h_{cv}=3.44$) using \code{bandwidth.CV} but we select it manually in
the following command due to long computation time.
%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> HH <- hill.ts(LoadCurve$data$Value, LoadCurve$data$Time, new.Tgrid,  
+    h = 3.44, kernel = TruncGauss.kernel, CritVal = 3.4)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
%
To detect the probability to cut off the breaker, we compute for each time in the grid the estimates of the probability to exceed the maximal power of $9$kVA and of the extreme $0.99$-quantile. Figure~\ref{EcrQuant} displays the electric consumption during the period of study and the estimated quantile of order $0.99$.

%
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> Quant <- rep(NA, length(Tgrid))
R> Quant[match(new.Tgrid,Tgrid)] <- as.numeric(predict(HH,

+    type = "l", ylab = "Electric consumption (kVA)", xlab = "Time")
R> lines(as.POSIXlt((Tgrid) * 86400, origin = "1970-01-01",

\end{Schunk}

\caption{Plot of the estimated survival probability depending on the
  time and the maximal power. The plus symbol corresponds to the
  electric constraint period.}
\label{EcrSurv}
\end{figure}
The plus symbol appears at the times when the maximal power was
decreased corresponding to the 11th, 13th, 18th of January, the 25th
of February and the 1st, 7th, 18th of March in 2016, with a
respectively decrease to $6.3$, $4.5$, $4.5$, $4.5$, $3.6$, $2.7$ and
$2.7$ kVA. Figure~\ref{EcrSurv} displays the estimated survival
probability which depends on the time and the maximal power. We can
observe that the survival probability is higher than usual during this
period. Furthermore, we have the auxiliary information that this
dwelling cuts off its breaker on every electric constraint period
except the 11th of January, 2016.

Using a prediction method coupled with the method implemented in the
package \pkg{extremefit}, it will be possible to detect high
probability of cutting off a breaker and react accordingly.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This paper focus on the functions contained in the package
\pkg{extremefit} to estimate extreme quantiles and probabilities of
rare events. The package \pkg{extremefit} works also well on large
data sets and the performance was illustrated on simulated data and on
real-world data sets.

The choice of the pointwise data driven threshold allows a flexible
estimation of the extreme quantiles. The diffusion of the use of this
method for the scientific community will improve the choice of
estimation of the extreme quantiles and probability of rare events
using the peak-over-threshold approach.
